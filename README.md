# KnowDDI: ML Model for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction

## Overview
KnowDDI is a machine learning model designed to predict potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The model analyzes molecular structures, pharmacological properties, and existing interaction data to identify potential adverse effects when multiple drugs are co-administered.

## Key Features
- Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions
- Analysis of molecular structures and properties
- Integration of pharmacological knowledge
- Support for both known and novel drug compounds
- Interpretable results with confidence scores

## Technical Stack
- Python with scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow
- Molecular fingerprinting with RDKit
- Graph neural networks for molecular representation learning
- Ensemble methods for prediction robustness
